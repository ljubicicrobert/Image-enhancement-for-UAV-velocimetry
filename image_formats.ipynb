Their use for computer vision tasks such as velocimetry is rare, possibly due to the late introduction of WebP support on PCs. OpenCV library supports WebP since 2013, but the initial support was rather buggy until versions 4.x.\n",

Lossless WebP version of the original image from [subsection 3.1](#jpeg) with image quality set to 100 (default in OpenCV) yields a file size of 123KB which is only 36.7% of the PNG image with compression level 1. Furthermore, this is a smaller file size than with JPEG image with quality set to 100 (by 22.6%), and is only 8.8% larger than JPEG with quality of 95 (default in OpenCV).\n",
