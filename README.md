# Jupyter notebooks on image enhancement for UAV velocimetry purposes

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ljubicicrobert/UAV_image_enhancement/main?labpath=main.ipynb)

This repository hosts the Jupyter notebooks overviewing different image formats, colorspace models, filtering methods, and interactions between the latter two for facilitating UAV velocimetrz. Notebooks are part of the report on Virtual Mobility Grant (VMG) awarded to the author by the COST Action HARMONIOUS (CA16219, funded by the European Cooperation in Science and Technology - COST Association).

Notebooks can be used/viewed in three ways:

1. By using the [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ljubicicrobert/UAV_image_enhancement/main?labpath=main.ipynb) webapp,
2. By downloading/cloning the repository and using the notebooks in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook evironment (read `requirements.txt`),
3. By reading static PDFs available in the `./PDFs` folder.
